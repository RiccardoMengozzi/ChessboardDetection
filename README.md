# ChessboardDetection
Real time chessboard detection, with object distance and dimensions estimation

IMPORTANT!!! A more recent (and definetely better written) version of the project (but in c++) can be found at: https://github.com/RiccardoMengozzi/ChessbaordDetection_cpp

# Basic Instructions
The project use a previously recorded stereo video and analyzes it simulating a real time video streaming, since a stereo camera was not available. If you are using a real stereo camera, that part of the code must be modified, once you have properly acquired the left and right frames and you have correctly passed them to the program, the script should work fine.

A report is present in the folder, that should be enough to explain the whole project.
